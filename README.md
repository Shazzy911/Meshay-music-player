* Implement functionalities for user registration, music browsing, and playback
* Integrate Redux for state management

#### Phase 3: Back-End Development

* Set up Express.js server with Node.js and Typescript
* Implement authentication and authorization using Firebase Authentication
* Develop GraphQL endpoints for efficient data retrieval
* Integrate PostgreSQL for database operations
* Implement real-time messaging using Socket.io

#### Phase 4: Integration and Testing

* Integrate front-end and back-end components
* Conduct unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing
* Ensure compatibility across devices and browsers

#### Phase 5: Deployment

* Containerize the application using Docker
* Deploy the application on Firebase Hosting or other suitable hosting platforms
* Configure Nginx for web server configuration and load balancing
* Monitor performance and scalability

### Evaluation Plan

#### Functional Testing

* Ensure all features work as expected

#### Usability Testing

* Gather feedback from users on ease of use, navigation, and design

#### Performance Testing

* Evaluate loading times, responsiveness, and scalability

#### Security Testing

* Ensure secure authentication and data encryption measures

#### Feedback Collection

* Utilize user surveys, A/B testing, and analytics tools

### Timeline

* Phase 1: 2 weeks
* Phase 2: 3 weeks
* Phase 3: 4 weeks
* Phase 4: 3 weeks
* Phase 5: Ongoing

### Expected Outcomes

* A fully functional music application
* An intuitive and responsive user interface
* Secure and reliable platform
* High-quality music playback
* Comprehensive documentation

### Challenges and Risks

* Ensuring data security and privacy
* Managing concurrent users and high traffic volumes
* Handling diverse user needs and content types
* Ensuring smooth integration of various technologies
* Maintaining real-time messaging functionality
* Developing a flexible and scalable platform
* Ensuring compatibility across different devices and browsers
